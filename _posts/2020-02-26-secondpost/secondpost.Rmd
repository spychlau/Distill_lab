```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, fig.height = 7) #this standardizes the height of everything in this post
```

Do a plot with layout = body outset because that looks better in the browser than the default option

```{r, layout = "l-body-outset"}

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, cyl)) +
  geom_point(color = "gray70") +
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_minimal()

```

The screen layout extends your plots to the screen's limits, whatever size that screen is

Do side notes with <aside> note <aside> 

Side notes show up below and not next to the plot when you use the screen layout because that's so big

Notice that you do need to knit before it goes up on the website!
